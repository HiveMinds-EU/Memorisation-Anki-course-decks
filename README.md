# Memorisation-Anki-course-decks
Anki decks for academic courses to help you memorize and study.

## How to use?
0. Download Anki, it's open source.
1. Import a "deck=set of flashcards", (flashcard = a memory card, with a question and answer).
2. Start "practicing your memory".
3. If you feel like it, you can `fork=copy`this `repository=folder`, add new flashcards and/or decks and click on `pull request=include my work pls`.

## Why?
Exams are supposed to be about understanding not memory. In my experience, some basic facts/"knowledge" is required to be able to interpret (and often succesfully answer) exam questions. Additionally, in my experience I have found I was a bit lazy in doing the work to memorize the required facts, hence forcing myself to do the (deck-creating and practicing) work with Anki increases my understanding and helps me identify some ambiguities/doubts/memory-weaknesses.
