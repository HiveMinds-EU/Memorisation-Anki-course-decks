   \begin{field}
       Give 2 reasons why it  is difficult to detect exoplanets using imaging. Start numbering as: 0. Reason.
   \end{field}
   \begin{field}
		0. Exoplanets are faint with respect to the star they orbit.
		1. Exoplanets orbit their stars relatively close.
   \end{field}
   \begin{field}
		Because they orbit their star so close, it is difficult to distinguish them from the star, and they might be obfuscated by the star for a large fraction of their orbit.
